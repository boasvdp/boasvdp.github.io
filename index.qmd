I'm a public health microbiologist at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Currently, I'm enrolled in the [EUPHEM](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/epiet-euphem) fellowship, organised by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The fellowship provides training and experience in microbiological and epidemiological methods for applied public health work. 

I'm also one of the coordinators of the SIG-BIMM (Special Interest Group for Bioinformatics in Medical Microbiology), part of the [NVMM](https://www.nvmm.nl/). We organise symposia twice per year on microbial bioinformatics, and in general try to advance the field in the Netherlands.
